# JWST_Planned_Observations

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks intended to assist JWST proposers with 
comparing their intended observations with those that are already approved, planned 
or have been executed with JWST, using the MAST API.

* Both notebooks rely on Python libraries from [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org)
* Detailed documentation for astroquery [is available](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Additional API notebooks are [available 
here](https://github.com/openSAIL/MAST-API-Notebooks)
* Additional MAST API documentation can be [found 
here](https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0/)
* Also, a simple command-line tool, based on astroquery, to retrieve JWST planned and HST existing observations is available.
